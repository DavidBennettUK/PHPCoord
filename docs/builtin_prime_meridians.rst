.. tip::
    Unless you are trying to work with a coordinate reference system that doesn't exist in the built-in set, you don't
    need to worry about these, the correct one will be instantiated for you.

.. tip::
    You can access the list of supported prime meridians at runtime using ``PrimeMeridian::getSupportedSRIDs()`` or
    ``PrimeMeridian::getSupportedSRIDsWithHelp()``
