Built in coordinate systems
===========================

.. note::
    In ISO 19111 terminology, what most people refer to as a *Coordinate System* is actually called a
    *Coordinate Reference System* (or *CRS* for short), with the term *Coordinate System* being used to refer to the
    :ref:`axes used <builtincs>`. PHPCoord's actual code uses the ISO naming system, although this documentation uses
    the more common version.
