Built in coordinate operation methods
=====================================

.. tip::
    Unless you are trying to register a custom coordinate operation, you do not need to worry about these, they are
    very much in the realm of implementation detail. For normal use, refer to
    :ref:`Coordinate Conversions<coordinate_conversions>`.

.. note::
    If you are interested in the full details (including formulas) for any particular method, please see the
    `EPSG guidance notes <https://github.com/dvdoug/PHPCoord/raw/master/resources/papers/373-07-2.pdf>`_
